## Exploratory Data Analysis
## Course Project 2

## Requires Data be saved in current working directory

## Read in Data
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

## 6. Compare emissions from motor vehical sources in Baltimore City
## with emissions from motor vehical sources in Los Angeles County,
## CA. Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor
## vehicle emissions?

## Load ggplot2 and plyr

library(ggplot2)

library(plyr)

## Obtain names of SCC which inclues "vehical" in EI.Sector

vehicallab <- unique(grep("Vehicles", SCC$EI.Sector,
ignore.case = T, value = T))

## Subset SCC by vehical labels

vehicalsub <- subset(SCC, EI.Sector %in% vehicallab)

## Subset NEI by vehicalsub

vehical <- subset(NEI, SCC %in% vehicalsub$SCC)

## Subset vehical data to include only Baltimore City

baltimore <- vehical[vehical$fips == "24510",]

## Subset vehical data to obtain LA County

LA <- vehical[vehical$fips == "06037",]

## Create single data frame with Baltimore City and LA data

BLA <- rbind(baltimore, LA)

## Find motor vehical emissions for Baltimore City and LA County
## by year

BLApm2.5 <- ddply(BLA, .(year, fips), function(x) sum(x$Emissions))

## Change "fips" to "County" and replace values with either Baltimore
## City or LA County and change "V1" to "Emissions"

colnames(BLApm2.5)[2] <- "County"

colnames(BLApm2.5)[3] <- "Emissions"

BLApm2.5$County <- ifelse(BLApm2.5$County == "06037", "Los Angeles", "Baltimore")

## Plot results

png("plot6.png")

qplot(year, Emissions, data = BLApm2.5, color = County, geom = "line") + 
ggtitle("Motor Vehical Emissions for Baltimore City and Los Angeles Counties")

## Turn device off

dev.off()

## Answer: Los Angeles has seen greater change in motor vehical emissions over time,
## having higher emissions overall and greater variability from 1999-2008.
