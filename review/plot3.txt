# Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad, nonroad) variable,
# which of these four sources have seen decreases in emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? 
# Which have seen increases in emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot answer this question.
